# CAS706-F2024
Repository for Fall 2024 version of CAS 706

This is based on [PLFA](https://github.com/plfa/plfa.github.io) and borrows substantially from [Prabhakar Ragde's](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/) course [CS 747](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/747/) which is an 'instance' of PLFA.

You will find
- in `handout`, the files used for CAS 706
- in `filled`, what we ended up doing during lectures
- in `filled/Exercises`, the assignments.

More material will get posted here as it arises. Such as what was covered in
the lectures, the extra material used, the assignments, etc.

Note that the *Exercises* assume that everything that was done in class,
i.e. the up-to-date content of 'filled' is accessible. This is why they
are in the slightly odd location of being inside 'filled'.
