Many of these exercises are straight out of PLFA. Others are
from the CS747 course at Waterloo.

```agda
module CAS706.A1 where

import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality as Eq
open Eq using (_≡_; refl; cong; sym)
open Eq.≡-Reasoning using (begin_; step-≡-∣; step-≡-⟩; step-≡-⟨; _∎)

open import Data.Nat using (ℕ; zero; suc; _+_; _*_; _∸_)
open import Data.Nat.Properties using (+-assoc; +-identityʳ; +-suc; +-comm)
```

Remember to add comments, in plain text before the code,
about your choices. And that add good tests. Both are
part of a good answer.

Exponentiation (10 points)
Define exponentiation (m raised to the power n).
0 ^ 0 = 1 for this exercise.

```agda
_^_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
m ^ n = {!!}

-- One test for exponentiation (you should write others).

_ : 2 ^ 3 ≡ 8
_ = refl
```

== The exercises below are on the Bin type

```agda
data Bin : Set where
  ⟨⟩ : Bin
  _O : Bin → Bin
  _I : Bin → Bin
```

Exercise: Increment (10 points)
Define increment (add one).

```agda
inc : Bin → Bin
inc m = {!!}

-- An example/test of increment (you should create others).

_ : inc (⟨⟩ I O I I) ≡ ⟨⟩ I I O O
_ = refl
```

Exercise: To/From (20 points)
Define 'tob' and 'fromb' operations
to convert between unary (ℕ) and binary (Bin-ℕ) notation.
Hint: avoid addition and multiplication,
and instead use the provided dbl (double) function.
This will make later proofs easier.
I've put 'b' on the end of the operations to
avoid a name clash in a later file.
It also makes the direction clear when using them.

```agda
dbl : ℕ → ℕ
dbl zero = zero
dbl (suc m) = suc (suc (dbl m))

tob : ℕ → Bin
tob m = {!!}

fromb : Bin → ℕ
fromb n = {!!}

-- A couple of examples/tests (you should create others).

_ : tob 6 ≡ ⟨⟩ I I O
_ = refl

_ : fromb (⟨⟩ I I O) ≡ 6
_ = refl
```

Exercise: BinAdd (20 points)
Write the addition function for binary notation.
Do NOT use 'to' and 'from'. Work with Bin-ℕ as if ℕ did not exist.
Hint: use recursion on both m and n.

```agda
_bin-+_ : Bin → Bin → Bin
m bin-+ n = {!!}
```
Tests can use to/from, or write out binary constants as below.
-- Again: write more tests!

```agda
_ : (⟨⟩ I O) bin-+ (⟨⟩ I I) ≡ (⟨⟩ I O I)
_ = refl
```

== Exercises below are back to proofs of facts about natural numbers

Exercise: AddSwap (10 point)
Please do this without using induction/recursion.

```agda
+-swap : ∀ (m n p : ℕ) → (m + n) + p ≡ n + (m + p)
+-swap m n p = {!!}
```

Exercise: AddDistMult (20 points)
Show that addition distributes over multiplication.

```agda
*-+-rdistrib : ∀ (m n p : ℕ) → (m + n) * p ≡ m * p + n * p
*-+-rdistrib m n p = {!!}
```

Exercise: MultAssoc (20 points)
Show that multiplication is associative.
```agda
*-assoc : ∀ (m n p : ℕ) → (m * n) * p ≡ m * (n * p)
*-assoc m n p = {!!}
```
Exercise: MultComm (30 points)
Show that multiplication is commutative.
As with the addition proof above, helper lemmas will be needed.
```agda
*-comm : ∀ (m n : ℕ) → m * n ≡ n * m
*-comm m n = {!!}
```

Exercise: LeftMonusZero (10 point)
PLFA asks "Did your proof require induction?"
(which should give you an indication of the expected answer).

```agda
0∸n≡0 : ∀ (m : ℕ) → zero ∸ m ≡ zero
0∸n≡0 m = {!!}
```

Exercise: MonusAssocish (20 points)
Show a form of associativity for monus.

```agda
∸-+-assoc : ∀ (m n p : ℕ) → m ∸ n ∸ p ≡ m ∸ (n + p)
∸-+-assoc m n p = {!!}
```

Bonus Exercise: distributive and associative laws for exponentiation
  (+40 points)
(part of the exercise involves stating these properly, then proving them.)

== Back to things about Bin

DoubleB (10 point)
Write the Bin version of dbl, here called dblb.
As with the other Bin operations, don't use tob/fromb.

```agda
dblb : Bin → Bin
dblb m = {!!}
```

Here are some properties of tob/fromb/inc suggested by PLFA Induction.
Please complete the proofs.

FromInc (10 point)

```agda
from∘inc : ∀ (m : Bin) → fromb (inc m) ≡ suc (fromb m)
from∘inc m = {!!}
```

FromToB (10 point)
```agda
from∘tob : ∀ (m : ℕ) → fromb (tob m) ≡ m
from∘tob m = {!!}
```
